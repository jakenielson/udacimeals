# Udacimeals

A simple meal planning app I built with React and Redux in Udacity's React Nanodegree program. The app provides an interface for selecting Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner meals for each day of the week from recipes fetched from a provided backend server. The user can then view a shopping list of all the ingredients needed to prepare the week's meals.

## To Run

To run the project, clone or download the repository and navigate to the root folder. Install the dependencies with `npm install`. Start the server with `npm start`.

## To Use

Click on a day on the calender to open the Find a Meal modal. Enter a search query and click the arrow button to search for meals. Click on a meal to add it to the calender.

Once you are done choosing meals, click on the Shopping List button to view the list of ingredients needed to prepare all of the meals.
